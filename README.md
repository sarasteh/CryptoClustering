# CryptoClustering
Here I use unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
 In part one, first the K-means model, with the best value for k, is initialized and fits on the scaled data  .
 Next the clusters are predicted to group the cryptocurrencies.
 In the second part, using the original scaled data, PCA is applied and reduces the features to three principal components.
 In the last part, the results of two above methods are visualized and compared.
