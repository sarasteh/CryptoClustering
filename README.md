# CryptoClustering
 Here we use unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
 In part one, first the K-means model, with the best value for k, is initialized and fit on the scaled data  .
 Next the clusters are predicted to group the cryptocurrencies.
 In the second part, using the original scaled data, we perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.
 In the last part we visulaze the results and compare the above two methods.
